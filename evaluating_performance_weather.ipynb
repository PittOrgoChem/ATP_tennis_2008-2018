In terms of the F-statistic, a value of 19,490 was obtained, confirming the ability of our model to explain significantly more target variance than an \"empty model\".

    "From the table above, we can conclude that this third model succesfully explains about 30% of the variance in the target variables. This R-square value represents an improvement in the explanatory power compared to Model #1 (29%) but is still outperformed by Model #2 (34%). In this case also, all included features were estimated as statistically significant. Concerning the F-statistic value, this new model is associated to a value of 14,010 while the original model was associated to a larger value of 19,490. In the case of Model #1 and Model #3, the former can be considered to be nested on the latter making this metric more relevant while comparing them. Judging by the F-statistic values, Model #1 could be considered more efficient explaining the variance in the target variable than Model #3, however, other metrics should be considered. Remember the F-statistics considers the performance of the model in comparison to an \"empty\" model\n",

    "In terms of the AIC and BIC metrics, the comparison between all three models reflects the conclusions drawn from comparing the R-squared values. Model #2 (333,400 - included the interaction between 'humidity' and 'windspeed') outperformed Model #3 (338,800 - included 'visibility') and Model #1 (340,900 - only 'humidity' and 'windspeed'). From these results, it seems that the inclusion of more features in the model, helped improved the explanatory power of the model resulting in an increase in the R-squared values and decreased AIC and BIC values. Also, in this particular case the inclusion of an engineered feature, such as the interaction between two of the existing variables, proved to be beneficial to the performance of the model"
